# Minimal-TCP-IP-Stack-
This is not a fully-fledged TCP/IP stack. I have created a minimal TCP/IP stack to understand the functionality of networking layers. It utilizes raw sockets, bypassing the embedded TCP/IP stack of the operating system.  The code builds custom layers such as the transport layer and network layer while bypassing the OS's networking stack.
